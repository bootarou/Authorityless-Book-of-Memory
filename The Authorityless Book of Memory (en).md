## **The Authorityless Book of Memory (権威なき記憶の書)**

### **Preface（序文）**

There is a saying by Satoshi Nakamoto:

“If you don’t believe it or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.”

— This statement represents the pinnacle of integrity for a creator, and simultaneously, symbolizes the fundamental stance of the blockchain structure itself.

Unfortunately, blockchain has become shrouded in money games,

and is being consumed as a tool for mutual deception.

Excessive government regulation is also attempting to crush the essence of this technology.

— If we forget the meaning of "recording," humanity will return once more to the illusion of trust.

This book is a silent warning to the present age,

and a message to the future.

This record is written not only for contemporaries,

but for readers one hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years from now—

for anyone who will still be on this earth, reading, verifying records, and seeking the truth.

If this book remains, even as a single fragment of data,

it will be proof that humanity chose not to forget.

### **Chapter 0: Memory in Peril — The Crisis of Digital Information**

The 21st century. Humanity holds all information in the palm of its hand.

Social media generates a torrent of emotions every second, and AI creates text and video faster and more eloquently than humans.

We seem to be living in a "Golden Age of Knowledge."

Yet, what is truly happening is the collapse of truth.

AI fabricates human faces, mimics voices, and depicts non-existent events as reality.

The internet has become a colossal illusionary space where truth and falsehood blend together.

And, ironically, we call it "convenient" and entrust our memories to it.

Data saved in the cloud can be erased at any time at the convenience of corporations.

When a social media account is closed, the daily records written there are lost too.

Just as people once entrusted the future to paper books,

modern individuals entrust their lives to the "digital cloud."

But that cloud can dissipate all too easily.

Links break, news is rewritten,

and the "past that might have been" generated by AI

will eventually cover the real history.

The question is no longer "What do we believe?" but

"What can we preserve as a record?"

If this continues, humanity will become a "civilization without memory."

Information is born instantly and forgotten immediately.

Truth is buried by view counts, and history is reconfigured by algorithms.

We are gaining knowledge while losing memory.

It was in the midst of this chaos, in 2008—

that a single paper was posted in a corner of the internet.

The title was “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”

It was not about currency.

It was the blueprint for a technology to allow humanity to save truth again: "an unalterable record."

At that moment, the world began to change silently.

The mechanism of "trust without trust" born from Bitcoin

would eventually transcend economics and social institutions,

and change the very nature of "human record-keeping."

In this era where misinformation consumes truth,

blockchain is humanity’s resistance to reclaim its memory.

This preface speaks of the beginning of that long journey.

### **Chapter 1: 2008, The Collapse of Trust**

#### **Section 1: The Eroding Trust**

In 2008, the world witnessed the "end of credit."

The collapse of Lehman Brothers was not merely a financial crisis.

It was the disintegration of the "centralized trust" that humanity had long believed in.

We lived by trusting banks, trusting governments, and trusting currency.

But when the world began to shake, that trust was nowhere to be found.

Humanity faced, for the first time, an era where "no one can be trusted."

Just one month later, a paper was posted in a corner of the internet.

The author's name was Satoshi Nakamoto.

What was written there was a system where mathematics bears the trust instead of humans—

the quiet beginning of the blockchain.

#### **Section 2: The Promise of Mathematics**

October 31, 2008\.

While the world was reeling from the aftershocks of the Lehman Shock,

a single PDF was posted to a cryptography mailing list.

The title: “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”

The author: an unheard-of name—Satoshi Nakamoto.

Whether that name belonged to a real person or a group of researchers, no one knows even now. But what he left behind was certain.

What was described there was a "mechanism where correctness is established even if no one is trusted."

No bank, no government, no contract, no witness is required.

Everything is proven by mathematics.

Transactions are encrypted, and every node verifies them mutually.

It does not presume honesty—

which is precisely why betrayal, lies, and alteration are impossible.

It was an order maintained not by human ethics, but by the logic of a formula.

At the heart of this mechanism is a small calculation called a "hash function."

It is like a "digital arrow" that only moves in one direction.

Once released, the arrow cannot be pulled back by anyone.

It is a mechanism designed to preemptively eliminate the possibility of human deceit.

What Satoshi wanted to create was not currency or investment, but a "society that makes the act of trust unnecessary."

Humans betray trust. But formulas do not.

He silently entrusted the concept of "credit," which humanity has endlessly fought over, to mathematics.

#### **Section 3: Trust without Trust**

Humans are creatures who believe.

We have believed in parents, nations, institutions, and money.

But that trust has always been betrayed.

It is always humans who lie, and it is the systems created by humans that collapse.

The revolution of Bitcoin lies in its fundamental negation of this human premise.

Satoshi Nakamoto designed a "trust for the purpose of not trusting"—

that is, the philosophy of “Don’t trust, verify.”

In this system, no one's word, title, or credit is the object of trust.

The only thing that can be trusted is the verifiable fact itself.

This is guaranteed by the distributed ledger shared by nodes worldwide—the blockchain.

All transactions are public, and anyone can verify them.

No central authority is needed; the evidence always resides within the block.

This mechanism of "trust through verification" ironically rediscovered the purest form of trust.

Because there are no secrets.

No lies, no privileges.

Everyone sees the same record and shares the same truth.

It was a trust established through transparency.

This philosophy coexists with a deep despair toward human society, yet a hope that does not give up on order.

Creating a trustworthy system in an age where no one can be trusted—

Satoshi's design was a redefinition of trust born precisely out of despair.

"Trust without trust."

That is the greatest paradox brought by the blockchain,

and the reason this technology is being passed down not merely as currency, but as a new ethical system.

#### **Section 4: The Stirring of a New Order**

January 3, 2009\.

The world was still in the midst of the Lehman Shock chaos.

Banks were seeking bailouts, governments were printing money,

and people were grappling with an invisible anxiety.

On that day, in a corner of the internet,

a single "block" was quietly generated.

— Block 0, the "Genesis Block."

It was the first transaction record of Bitcoin,

and the "first page" of a new era.

Embedded within it was a single line of message:

“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

This quote was not merely a news citation.

It was a cynicism toward the times, and a declaration.

A silent protest against a financial system continually dependent on the central bank.

Simultaneously, it was a statement of intent: "We no longer need you."

The moment this message was engraved,

humanity possessed a "record by technology, not by a state or corporation," for the first time.

It is not a history written by power,

but a history established through verification.

The Genesis Block is not just data.

It was the "proof of trust, first left by a society without trust."

Within this small block,

the bud of a new order had certainly begun to stir.

Eventually, this philosophy would spread beyond the boundaries of currency.

The ideal of "decentralization" would ripple through not just capital, but

governance, art, culture, and record-keeping itself.

Technology began to change from a mere tool into the ethical code that runs society.

Behind the history written by humans,

technology began writing another history.

That beginning was January 3, 2009\.

### **Chapter 2: Bitcoin as Philosophy — The Democracy of Decentralization and the Life-like Order that Preserves Time**

#### **Section 1: Philosophy, Not Currency**

While the world called Bitcoin "new money,"

what Satoshi Nakamoto aimed for was far more fundamental.

It was not mere digital currency.

— It was the implementation of a philosophy.

What Bitcoin created was not a mechanism for "trusting someone,"

but a social structure for "everyone to share the same rules and mutually monitor each other."

It was the archetype of a new order, which could be called the democracy of decentralization.

The rule of Proof of Work is a mechanism that proves truth through the "effort" of computation.

In other words, truth is guaranteed by effort.

This is where the ethics of Bitcoin reside.

Correctness is determined not by someone's authority,

but by the sheer "work" accumulated by computers worldwide.

There is no central leader, no judge.

Only computation and time accumulate equally.

The blockchain preserves this accumulation as a "record."

The past cannot be rewritten; only the future, which includes all the past, is appended.

What was born there was humanity's first unalterable "record of time."

Just as the invention of money created the "record of value,"

Bitcoin created the "record of truth."

It was not the evolution of currency,

but the evolution of society itself.

#### **Section 2: The Democracy of Decentralization**

In the world of Bitcoin, there is no ruler.

No one issues commands, and no administrator determines correctness.

Yet, the whole maintains order and continues to move seamlessly.

— A strange harmony that exists precisely because there is no center.

At the heart of this system lies the philosophy of "democracy of decentralization."

It was a new form of society where all participants equally share the rules, mutually monitor each other,

and everyone is equally involved in the establishment of "truth."

There are no elections or representatives here.

Every node holds one vote,

and the world moves forward only when there is unanimous agreement.

What emerges at this point is Proof of Work (PoW)—

the ethic of "proving truth through effort."

Truth is not bestowed by authority.

It quietly surfaces through the accumulation of people's computation and time.

The effort of each individual overlaps with the effort of others somewhere in the world,

and this consensus is called "truth."

Within this democracy, the world saw the germination of a new, centerless order for the first time.

It was not chaos, but rather founded on quiet cooperation.

Rules were no longer something made by someone, but something grown by everyone through adherence.

Eventually, this accumulation, like the ticking of a clock, became individual blocks,

creating humanity's first unalterable "record of time."

It was not currency, but the proof of time crystallized by effort and agreement.

The past cannot be rewritten by anyone.

Only the future is created from this very moment.

Within that sequence, Bitcoin embedded the seed of a new technology and civilization.

#### **Section 3: The Unalterable Record of Time**

For a long time, humanity has continued the act of "recording."

It was the very beginning of civilization,

and the only means to pass the past to the future.

However, all those records were destined to be "rewritten."

Stone tablets, paper, and servers—

they have all been scraped, torn, and overwritten at some point.

The origin of the record was unclear, and it was an activity constantly facing oblivion.

In 2009, when Bitcoin was born,

the world gained an unalterable record of time for the first time.

Though data, it was no longer mere information.

The very flow of time is built into the record.

The security of this world is not guarded by walls.

It is structured so that the architecture itself resists cyber-attack.

All transactions are converted in one direction by the "digital arrow" of the hash function,

and once released, the arrow can never be reversed.

A structure that is digital, yet preemptively contains its own threat—

that was the fundamental strength of the blockchain.

Every block refers to the block before it, connected like a chain.

There, the past record supports the future, and the future record proves the past.

In existing systems, changes to the past did not affect the future.

Even with timestamps, each record was merely an independent fragment of the world;

time was not continuous.

But Bitcoin implemented a clearly continuous time axis in the world of digital data.

The past supports the safety of the future, and the past is proven from the future—

that mutual dependency is a form of defense that never existed before.

Bitcoin turned time itself into defense.

The past is closed, and only the future is appended.

Everything is a forward-moving arrow,

and this "irreversibility" was the purest form of security.

This chain cannot be cut by anyone.

It leaves no room for alteration, and theoretically, it continues to regenerate as long as the consensus of the participants continues.

Diverse trials were repeated, and the network as a whole evolved as if learning from experience.

Its structure was technological, yet it resembled the life-like order our own DNA has repeated.

Bitcoin did not just invent currency.

It was a mechanism that protected the record of time itself.

In the digital world, the "past" is finally fixed, and the "future" accumulates.

At that moment, humanity obtained a way to preserve time not as data, but as existence.

### **Chapter 3: Smart Contracts — The Automation of Promise**

#### **Section 1: A World Where Code Makes Promises**

In 2013, when the fervor for Bitcoin had not yet subsided,

a young man began to speak of a new dream.

His name—Vitalik Buterin.

He was just a 19-year-old programmer raised in Canada.

He asked:

"Could we run not only currency, but all promises on the blockchain?"

The idea was simple, and beautiful.

If a condition is met, execute the next action.

If – Then.

He believed this small structure would become the mechanism that runs the world.

What he envisioned was a blockchain that codified not only currency records, but contracts and the rules of society itself.

That would later be called Ethereum.

Smart Contract—this mechanism, named "clever contract,"

writes promises humans used to write on paper as code, and executes them automatically.

If the condition is met, payment is made.

If signatures are collected, the transaction is completed.

No court, no lawyer, no bank is needed.

The world itself executes the rules.

The impact of this technology was immense.

"Transactions can be made with untrustworthy parties through code."

It was called a revolution since the internet.

Humanity was finally about to obtain a "society where promises are automatically kept."

No one commands, no one judges,

and justice and order are maintained equally by a machine.

This philosophy immediately captivated developers worldwide.

They flocked to build their societies on the blockchain.

Small currencies, communities, games, autonomous organizations—

everything moved by code, transparent, fair, and unstoppable.

At the time, the world believed:

Code is more honest than human promises.

Smart Contracts were the moment technology finally implemented "ethics."

— It was one of the most beautiful dreams since the birth of Bitcoin.

#### **Section 2: The Dark Chain — The Collapse of the Perfect Promise**

The Smart Contract was the crystallization of the ideal humanity envisioned.

If the condition is met, the promise is automatically fulfilled.

No one lies, no one betrays.

Perfect fairness.

— But that perfection was the first flaw.

In 2016, a grand experiment was launched on Ethereum.

Its name was The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

It was an attempt at a "decentralized organization" that would autonomously make investment decisions.

No human managers, no executives.

All decision-making would be executed by smart contracts.

It was truly the birth of an "organization beyond human."

But just a few weeks after its launch.

A flaw in the program was exploited, and approximately $60 million worth of assets were drained.

It was not hacking.

— The code was operating correctly.

The contract was executed as promised.

It was just that the promise itself was flawed.

Yet, the blockchain does not stop.

The "If – Then" command continued to advance coldly,

eternally accumulating the "correctly designed error."

The world witnessed the moment a perfect system made a perfect mistake—the engineering paradox of "error according to specification."

This incident cast the first shadow over the faith in technology.

People debated.

— Should it be left alone, or rolled back?

And finally, those who trusted Ethereum ironically decided to alter the past.

The blockchain, which was supposed to be "immutable," forked due to human judgment.

That is the current Ethereum and the Ethereum Classic which remained without accepting the alteration.

At that moment, the blockchain reclaimed "trust" for the first time.

But it was the "human trust" that Bitcoin had once rejected.

The philosophy of immutability collapsed with a single fork.

The rules of society are not immutable.

They change with the times and easily waver with values.

It is the softness of the human existence that understands this.

But the smart contract stripped away that softness.

It froze ethics, turned good and evil into conditional statements, and attempted to eliminate human imperfection.

The result was a machine that errs like a human, but cannot be fixed.

No forgiveness, no reinterpretation.

Code became not law, but command and fate.

The Smart Contract envisioned a dream where "technology transcends society."

But that dream forgot humanity.

And the technology that forgets humanity

will always be betrayed by humans eventually.

Since the DAO incident, smart contracts have been handled cautiously.

But the scars remain deep.

The day the blockchain first "rewrote the past"—

it was not technological progress, but the collapse of an ideal.

Outside the "quiet order" built by Bitcoin,

the smart contract once again evoked human "desire" and "ethics."

At that moment, the blockchain ceased to be a "pure order."

— When humanity was reclaimed within perfection,

what appeared there was not hope, but fragility.

---

### **Chapter 4: The Birth of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**

#### **Section 1: What the Original DAO Is**

When the era of smart contracts dawned,

the world was buzzing with new hope.

Automatically functioning contracts, unstoppable rules,

organizations without human intermediaries—DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

But many of the DAOs that materialized

were nothing like the ideal.

They were investment clubs, governance games,

and ultimately, new stories of centralization centered around "who holds what authority."

Even as DAOs were called "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations,"

many became organizations dominated by smart contracts,

bound by the "moving rules" themselves.

Organizations that couldn't change their rules eventually diverged from society,

becoming rigid and losing flexibility.

#### **Section 2: The Disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto and the "True DAO"**

But the origin of the DAO was, in the first place,

Bitcoin itself.

Satoshi Nakamoto—

He created Bitcoin as the central administrator,

and after witnessing its completion, he himself abandoned the position and vanished.

The act of leaving no authority behind was the very first implementation of the DAO.

No one manages him.

No one monopolizes the system.

Decision-making is entrusted to nodes worldwide,

and consensus is achieved not through dialogue, but through verification.

This "centerless order" is the true nature of the DAO.

It is a network of mutual aid that holds no command or dominance.

It would be similar to imagining a Jomon village from prehistory.

There was no king or state.

People supported and helped each other within the cycle of nature,

maintaining the community without anyone standing at the center.

Bitcoin was the first civilization model to reproduce that structure with technology.

#### **Section 3: The Rules Are Off-Chain**

The misunderstanding of the term DAO stems from confusing "autonomous" with "automatic."

Autonomy is not about moving automatically.

It is the power to think for oneself and decide in harmony.

Smart contracts attempted to embed rules within the blockchain.

But rules are the products of society,

a "living consensus" that changes with the times.

To fix them is tantamount to confining life.

Rules should be off-chain.

Human conversation, culture, values—they shape the rules.

The role of the blockchain should be to verify and record whether those rules were "kept."

The mistake made by the smart contract was reversing this order.

By attempting to control society with code,

it caused society to lose its "breath."

The DAO is a relationship, not a rule.

It is a mechanism for "being together,"

and the blockchain only supports the transparency and memory of that relationship.

#### **Section 4: The Future of Bitcoin-like DAO**

The essence of the DAO demonstrated by Bitcoin is a society where no one stands at the center, and everyone shares responsibility.

It was an infrastructure for autonomous coexistence, not forced governance.

By vanishing, Satoshi Nakamoto allowed Bitcoin to become a "system belonging to no one" forever.

This was not a defect, but rather its complete form.

It is similar to the myth where humanity walks independently, having departed from the Godhead.

It is not an "automated corporation" running on smart contracts.

It is a social consciousness where responsibility is distributed and shared.

The DAO is the creation of a Godless society and the fairest thing.

If technology leads civilization back to "nature" again,

its origin will be this philosophy.

No center, rejection of dominance,

records remain, but no commands exist.

— It is like a digital society resembling the Jomon circle.

#### **Section 5: The Dawn of Digital Coexistence Civilization**

The prototype of the DAO drawn by Satoshi Nakamoto

might have been a structure for civilization to return to "nature" again, rather than a technological future.

It rejects the center, refuses domination,

and maintains order through dialogue and verification.

It is a form of "coexistence" that modern systems have forgotten.

If the future DAO returns to this origin,

what will emerge is a network of relationships, not rules.

A society connected by memory, not commands.

A civilization supported by sharing, not competition.

The Bitcoin-like DAO is the "beginning of humanity" seen at the end of technology.

It is the other, warmer future hidden deep within the cold order brought by the blockchain.

---

### **Chapter 5: Blockchain Digital Archive — The Recording Civilization**

#### **Section 1: The Act of Recording — The Origin of Humanity**

Human civilization always began with "recording."

Hunting traces etched on cave walls, trading numbers inscribed on clay tablets,

parchment, print, film, magnetic media, digital—

Humans have tried to preserve their existence across ages.

A record is not just information.

It is the proof that "we certainly lived," and a message to the future.

However, what has always supported those records

was the structure of the "writer" and the "reader."

There were always those who chose and those who erased.

In every era, the record was tied to power.

Who preserves and who deletes?

Who tells the truth and who silences?

The record was always placed within the structure of domination.

The advent of blockchain fundamentally changed this structure.

There, the "recorder" and the "recorded" become the same.

Everyone becomes a verifier, and everyone becomes a preserver.

Beyond platform owners and markets, everyone can transmit, and everyone becomes a witness to the future.

It was the moment the act of recording became a shared endeavor for the first time.

#### **Section 2: Bitcoin Records "Time," Symbol Records "Meaning"**

What Bitcoin implemented was "unalterable time."

All transactions were chained like links,

and for the first time in human history, the flow of time was defined within the digital realm.

That record was absolute, a mathematical proof guaranteeing the past.

But that time was still silent.

Only signatures, numerical values, and hash values existed,

and why the transaction occurred, what it meant—

"Context" and "will" were not recorded.

Bitcoin left facts, but it could not yet speak of memory.

The next-generation blockchain, Symbol, transcended that limit.

Symbol is not just a remittance ledger;

it is equipped with a Message Field in each transaction.

This small structural change evolved the technology based on Bitcoin

from a "time recording device" to a "meaning recording device."

In Symbol, token transfer (remittance) and message writing are handled at the same level.

That is, "the movement of value" and "the description of knowledge" coexist equally within the same transaction.

#### **Section 3: Significance from a Blockchain History Perspective**

The Symbol message field

extends the inherent philosophy of the blockchain—"accumulating signed data in a time series"—in its purest form.

However, the author does not know how much the Symbol developers intended this.

* Remittance \= History of Value (**Value Ledger**)  
* Message \= History of Knowledge and State (**Knowledge Ledger**)

The fact that these two are handled on the same transaction layer means that

economic value and intellectual value coexist within the same "chain of time."

Just as Bitcoin guaranteed "currency trust" with mathematics,

Symbol implemented "knowledge trust" on the blockchain.

It is the first case to extend the blockchain from a mere Value Ledger to a Knowledge Ledger.

Due to this structure,

a transaction is no longer just a record but an "event with meaning."

The block does not distinguish between economic and informational activity,

preserving the entirety of human actions as a single, time-series narrative.

The Symbol message field is the function that gives "why" to data,

indicating that the blockchain has evolved from a "vessel for economics" to a "vessel for knowledge."

If Bitcoin "preserved time," Symbol "preserved meaning." (Or both).

And that "meaning" is not only value but the very philosophy of how humans sought to understand and share the world.

At this moment, the blockchain transcended being a mere collection of histories,

and ascended to the Knowledge Ledger—the memory structure of civilization.

#### **Section 4: The Ethics of Permanent Preservation**

However, an "unerasable record" is a blessing and a curse.

The inability to alter the past means that mistakes are also sealed forever.

The ethics in a Blockchain Digital Archive involve choosing what to preserve and what not to preserve.

That choice is not mere data management, but an act of responsibility toward the future.

Now that technology guarantees the permanence of records,

what is being questioned is "what humans want to leave behind."

A record is not just preservation;

it is a form of will that speaks to the future.

#### **Section 5: The Ideological Significance of the Blockchain Digital Archive**

Blockchain was born as a tool for economics,

but its essence is a civilization's recording device.

The "recording of meaning" led by the Symbol message field

becomes a "cultural storehouse" in the information society,

recording thoughts, arts, science, and all daily events as humanity's shared property.

The archive is no longer a museum;

the network itself becomes the archive.

It is not a system to manage data,

but a public good for preserving human memory.

Blockchain is the structure where technology has taken over the "faith in recording" once borne by religion and the state.

Truth is guaranteed not by a god or a government,

but by a consensus achieved through mathematics and sharing.

#### **Section 6: The Future Data Society — A New Era Where Records Continue to Move**

In the future society,

human knowledge, records, and even emotions will exist scattered across networks.

Many of them will be inscribed on blockchains containing messages like Symbol,

and preserved long-term in an unalterable state.

But the record will no longer be "static data."

As AI analyzes these records, connects them, and

reconstructs their context, the information will constantly generate new meanings.

For example, much of the likely correct data today

dies as tacit knowledge, unable to overcome the walls of power or technology.

Research data from one era,

cultural records from another country, and personal diaries,

will be reconnected by AI analysis,

giving birth to insights no one had noticed before.

In this way, the record becomes not just a preserved object, but a learning ecosystem of knowledge.

The significance of publicly available, unalterable data is immeasurably large.

The countless data inscribed in the Symbol message field

will be reread, given meaning, and cited with correct metadata by AI.

Each time, the record gains a new, verifiable context.

A message once written by a human will be deciphered again by someone in the future,

and connected with data from different cultures and eras.

What emerges there is a "society where knowledge analysis systems (AI) continuously understand the records left by humans."

The record changes from a fixed entity into a "dynamic memory" that is updated along with human thought.

Such an archive is not a mechanism for preserving the past,

but a foundation for creating the future.

As the past and future are connected by data,

and AI mediates this connection,

a society where humanity's total knowledge is constantly evolving will be formed.

Bitcoin created the "record of time,"

Symbol implemented the "record of meaning,"

and AI reconstructs them,

enabling humanity to evolve into a "civilization that thinks using records."

### **Chapter 6: How the Blockchain Digital Archive Changes Human Knowledge — "Verifiable Records" of History, Culture, and Science**

#### **Section 1: The Foundation of Truth — Beyond the Era of Fake Information**

In a world saturated with information, truth is determined by the loudest voice.

News is re-edited, history is rewritten,

and even scientific papers amplify errors within a chain of citations.

The boundary between "fact" and "interpretation" is now ambiguous,

and "truth" exists only within human cognition.

In this chaos, humanity for the first time required a "foundational record base for truth."

That is the Blockchain Digital Archive (BDA).

The blockchain assigns a cryptographic signature to the record at the time of its occurrence, and saves it in a time-series manner, unalterable.

This "verifiable history" is fundamentally different from the counterfeiting and editing produced by AI.

What information was generated, when, and by whom—

this remains as a structure that is mathematically provable.

As this technology spreads,

the internet transforms from a "platform for transmission" to a "platform for verification."

Truth becomes not something to believe, but something that anyone can objectively reproduce.

#### **Section 2: The Legitimacy of History — New Historiography Created by Unalterable Records**

History has always been written by the victors.

But with the advent of the Blockchain Digital Archive,

the rewriting of historical facts becomes technically impossible.

Events, statements, literature, reports, and statistics from each era—

all are recorded on the same generation and timeline,

existing as "time-series historical sources" that anyone can verify.

For example, if a statement by a certain nation

contradicts a report from another country at the same time,

it is instantly possible to determine which was the primary source

from the hash values and signature histories of both.

History changes from a competition of interpretation

to a discipline determined by the integrity of records.

As a result, there is no longer a "writer of history";

everyone becomes a "subject that preserves history."

#### **Section 3: The Transparency of Science — A Verifiable Academic Base**

Scientific progress has often been hampered by

the "lack of reproducibility" and "non-disclosure of data."

Research data is lost after paper publication,

and only unverified findings are cited.

The Blockchain Digital Archive fundamentally changes this structure.

The research process, hypotheses, experimental data, and analysis results—

all are recorded with timestamps,

and preserved in a verifiable form along with the researcher's signature.

Fraudulent data alteration is immediately detected,

and the reproduction of research results can be done by anyone by deciphering the block.

Science returns to its origin: the chain-like verification of knowledge, not the ownership of papers.

The Symbol message field supports this mechanism.

Numerical data and semantic information are recorded as a unit within the transaction.

This means that while Bitcoin "guaranteed time,"

Symbol implemented the technology that "guarantees context."

#### **Section 4: The Preservation of Culture — Memory That Cannot Be Rewritten**

Culture was once born with trends and vanished.

Internet records are platform-dependent,

and if a service is terminated by someone,

individual works and thoughts can easily disappear.

The Blockchain Digital Archive preserves records of creation and expression in an unalterable form.

Poetry, videos, music, diaries—

all are saved in a time series with individual signatures.

This makes culture not something "left behind," but a data organism that continues to exist in a chain.

Cultural value is measured not by trends or markets,

but by its continuous reference history.

The blockchain has finally become the "cultural memory device."

#### **Section 5: Justice and Journalism — A Social Structure of Transparency**

The trust of the judiciary is supported by

the preservation of evidence and the transparency of procedure.

The Blockchain Digital Archive preserves case law, evidence data, and trial records in an immutable form,

making the process of judicial judgment itself verifiable.

Similarly, the reliability of journalism is reconstructed

by recording the editing history and publishing signature.

Journalism that explicitly shows "when," "who," and "how" it was written

is no longer propaganda, but a publicly verified record.

In this way, the blockchain archive

has ended the "claim without evidence" in all domains: law, journalism, science, and and culture.

#### **Section 6: The Reconstruction of Knowledge — Toward a Civilization that Records**

Human knowledge has been systematized under authority until now.

But with the advent of the Blockchain Digital Archive,

that structure has been fundamentally reorganized.

Knowledge is no longer the property of academic societies or governments.

All insights are made public,

and their integrity can be verified by anyone.

The legitimacy of knowledge is guaranteed by the transparency of the record.

This is the democratization of academia,

the redefinition of culture,

and the reconstruction of civilization.

Just as Bitcoin redefined the "trust of currency,"

and Symbol implemented the "trust of knowledge,"

the blockchain archive changed the very structure of autonomous and decentralized truth.

The future this technology indicates is a society driven by

"what can be verified," not "what is believed."

And the foundation of that society is no longer authority, but the record itself.

### **Chapter 7: The Eternal Library — The New Form of Human Record — Blockchain as the "Library That Does Not Perish"**

#### **Section 1: The Memory of Alexandria**

The library built in ancient Alexandria, Egypt,

was the first place in human history to gather "the world's knowledge in one location."

Astronomy, philosophy, mathematics, medicine—

knowledge in all fields was stored as scrolls,

and it was truly the center of civilization, a symbol of knowledge.

However, at some point, that library burned down.

Much of what was written turned to ashes,

and humanity once lost its own memory.

— This tragedy gave birth to the dream of the "Library that does not perish."

If there were a mechanism where knowledge did not rely on physical media,

could be referenced from anywhere in the world,

and everyone could be an equal preserver—

the fire of Alexandria would never have been repeated.

The Blockchain Archive is the "new library" that has been resurrected in the modern age as the realization of that dream.

#### **Section 2: NFTDrive — The Choice for Data That Does Not Perish**

Ten years after the birth of the blockchain.

NFTDrive is what tackled the problem of data permanence head-on.

NFTDrive expansively utilizes blockchain transaction messages to

implement a mechanism that completely saves all digital data—images, documents, audio, and video—on-chain.

It is not merely an NFT (Non-Fungible Token).

NFTDrive is aimed not at proof of ownership, but at the preservation of existence itself.

While typical NFTs rely on external servers or IPFS links,

NFTDrive's archive fragments and encodes the data itself,

writing it as a blockchain transaction message.

Through this mechanism, the file becomes part of the network itself.

It cannot be erased.

It cannot be altered.

Even if the owner disappears, the data remains.

NFTDrive is an architecture that actually achieved "permanent digital records" for the first time in human history,

and it was also the first chapter of the "Library that does not perish."

#### **Section 3: CHRONOTH — A Blog System Where Records Keep Speaking**

The philosophy of NFTDrive took another step forward.

That is the full on-chain blog system, CHRONOTH (Chronos).

Based on the concept that merges "Chronos (Time)" and "Thought,"

CHRONOTH carves human records directly onto the blockchain,

building a "narrative space of time" that no one can delete.

A post is not merely an article.

Each one remains as a knowledge block with a timestamp.

Revisions and updates are chained as new transactions,

forming a "history of thought" itself.

In contrast to SNS or blogs that vanish at the convenience of platforms,

the words inscribed in CHRONOTH accumulate over time.

Individual voices, emotions, research, art—

all are preserved as time-series blocks,

and someone in the future will spin new knowledge from those fragments.

CHRONOTH symbolizes the evolution from a "medium that leaves records" to a "medium where records continue to live."

#### **Section 4: Individual Records Make Civilization**

In the past, only nations, large corporations, and academic societies could leave records.

But with the emergence of NFTDrive and CHRONOTH,

a single individual became a recorder of the world.

This means that the thoughts and emotions of nameless people

are directly embedded in the civilization's layer of knowledge.

A single sentence left by a poet might change future philosophy.

A student's research notes might become the foundation for a scientist centuries later.

Daily records might be reread as primary historical sources.

This "permanent preservation of individual records" is an event that collapses the centralization of knowledge.

Archiving by blockchain is not just a preservation technology;

it is the reclamation of humanity's right to record.

#### **Section 5: Democratization of Record, Liberation of Memory**

NFTDrive implemented the "record that does not perish,"

and CHRONOTH opened the "record that keeps speaking" to society.

What these two demonstrate is

the essence of the blockchain—the democratization of the record.

The record is no longer the asset of corporations or states.

Anyone can own their own record, share it,

and entrust it to the future.

And that is simultaneously the liberation of memory.

The voices of people who were forgotten and buried

breathe life again within the blocks.

The "Eternal Library" is not

a colossal facility or a specific platform.

It is a community of records woven by the nodes of all humanity.

Just as Bitcoin reclaimed the "freedom of currency,"

NFTDrive and CHRONOTH reclaimed the "freedom of the record."

Humanity has now begun to walk a civilization that lives with the record and passes it down with the record.

---

### **Final Chapter: The Authorityless Book of Memory**

Why do humans record?

It is not to avoid forgetting, nor to remember.

Recording is the act of entrusting proof of existence to the future.

People once inscribed history in the name of God or King.

The record was a tool of power, a means of domination.

But with the birth of the blockchain,

the record became something that belonged to no one for the first time.

What Bitcoin demonstrated was the discovery that "humanity can build trust without relying on authority."

It is a revolution of the record, as well as a revolution of currency.

Symbol inherited that lineage,

making it possible to inscribe "meaning" and "will" into data.

Transactions, words, knowledge—

all are recorded equally within the same chain of time.

It is a ledger that shares human thought itself,

a new structure for civilization.

And now, AI is reconstructing them,

beginning to decipher the messages left by humans.

The record is no longer static;

it is evolving into a learning book of memory.

However, this record is not eternal like stone.

Stone might remain even if humanity perishes,

but all open-source programs

presume continuous maintenance and symbiosis

by humans or by an evolved AI.

It is not a solitary eternity,

but permanence contingent on continuous engagement.

This network is not just maintained.

Reward and curiosity, desire and philosophy, contribution and approval—

these human impulses circulate as an ecosystem.

Miners, node operators, developers, users, investors—

their respective motives and agendas are still turning the invisible "network flywheel."

This rotation is what keeps the blockchain alive.

Blockchain technology continues to run because human desire does not stop it.

Satoshi Nakamoto is no longer present.

Yet, his code still runs worldwide,

and his philosophy breathes within the blocks.

This very absence proves that the blockchain lives beyond human.

The blocks on the Symbol chain, carrying data, are quietly accumulating today.

Someone's thought, someone's record, someone's voice.

None of them are the property of a state or a corporation,

but the shared property of all humanity.

This "recording civilization" is the symbol of an age

where humanity can preserve memory for the first time

in a way that is not dominated by authority.

— Blockchain is the "Authorityless Book of Memory,"

liberated from human authority.

And that book is not yet finished being written.

Today, in the hands of small communities,

it continues to be recorded, quietly and surely.

### **Glossary of Terms（巻末付録：用語小辞典）**

| Term | Definition |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Hash** (ハッシュ) | A function that converts data into a fixed-length string of numbers and letters. Even an enormous amount of data is always converted to the same length, and if the content changes by even one character, the resulting value is entirely different. This **"one-way"** and **"unpredictable"** nature allows the hash to function as the blockchain's **"seal of truth."** Every record is protected by this small string of characters. |
| **Block** (ブロック) | The **"unit of record"** that bundles together a collection of transactions and messages. One block contains multiple transactions and is connected like a chain by referring to the hash of the preceding block. This chain is called the **"blockchain,"** and it is the mechanism that mathematically fixes the flow of time itself. |
| **Transaction** (トランザクション) | A **"single event"** that takes place on the blockchain. Any action—remittance, contract, message—is recorded as a transaction. It is the **"log of human action,"** and the story etched into each block of the blockchain. |
| **Metadata** (メタデータ) | **"Information about the data"** embedded within the data. For example, supplementary information such as who, when, and for what purpose it was created. The process of preservation varies depending on the blockchain. |
| **Address** (アドレス) | An identifier indicating a **"location"** on the blockchain. It looks like a bank account, but is actually a public identification number derived from a cryptographic key. Just as humans have names, nodes and accounts have addresses. The transactions sent to them become the **"footprints"** of the digital world. |
| **Node** (ノード) | The **"individual participants"** that constitute the blockchain. Nodes hold, verify, and synchronize data with other nodes. No one is the center; everyone is equally a recorder and a witness. This decentralized structure makes the blockchain imperishable. |
| **Genesis Block** (ジェネシスブロック) | The very first block. It is the starting point of all records and corresponds to the **"book of Genesis"** for the world. In Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto inscribed a sentence from the news. That single line became the **"First Inscription"** in the technological civilization. |
| **Smart Contract** (スマートコントラクト) | A contract program that is automatically executed according to pre-set conditions. It converts human promises into code using the simple logic of **"If \- Then."** A new form of law that entrusts trust not to humans, but to machine verification. |
| **DAO** (自律分散型組織) | Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A community operated by smart contracts without a central leader. However, the original DAO was predicated on the **"autonomy"** of humans, not machines. The essence is the order where no one is at the center, like Bitcoin. |
| **NFT** (非代替性トークン) | Non-Fungible Token. A digital certificate with **"unique identifying information in the world."** Applicable not only to art and certificates but also to the record itself. NFT is the first form in which humanity acquired **"uniqueness"** in the digital realm. |
| **NFTDrive** (エヌエフティドライブ) | Technology that extends the blockchain transaction message to completely save data such as images, videos, audio, and documents **on-chain.** It does not rely on external servers, but etches the data itself into the network. The first system to realize the concept of **"data that does not perish"** as actual technology. It is, so to speak, **"a part of humanity's first immortal library."** |
| **CHRONOTH** (クロノス) | Full on-chain blog system. It preserves human thought and records as blocks over time. Article updates are accumulated as **"new transactions,"** becoming a **"living record"** that cannot be deleted or altered. Its name is derived from **"Chronos (Time)" and "Thought."** CHRONOTH is the prototype of a "medium where records continue to speak." |
| **Message Field** (メッセージ領域) | The free-text area implemented in the Symbol blockchain's transaction data. By embedding text and data directly here, the block changes from a mere numerical value to a **"meaning-laden record."** It is the element that supports the foundation of NFTDrive and CHRONOTH. |
| **Full On-chain** (フルオンチェーン) | A method of saving all data directly onto the blockchain. It integrates the data itself into the network without using links or external servers. It is not "preservation" but **"incorporation as part of existence,"** an attempt to overlay human memory onto the technology itself. |
| **Hash Chain** (ハッシュチェーン) | The cryptographic sequence that links blocks together. Since each block includes the hash value of the previous block, changing the past invalidates all of the future. This structure generates **"unalterability."** The chain of time is a chain of memory made of mathematics. |
| **Timestamp** (タイムスタンプ) | The proof of time etched onto an event. Not just a date, but a cryptographic evidence that **"the information existed at that exact moment."** By fixing time, information gains permanence. |
| **Consensus** (ノード間合意) | A mechanism where multiple nodes agree that **"the same record is correct."** This allows truth to be established without a central judge. Methods like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are used. It is a structure that can be called the algorithmic reproduction of democracy. |
| **Knowledge Ledger** (ナレッジレジャー) | A ledger that records **Knowledge,** not value. An advanced concept brought about by the Symbol message field (including its predecessor, NEM). A new archive model that treats economic and ideological acts as equivalent. It is the word that symbolizes the **"era when blockchain preserves knowledge."** |
| **Blockchain Digital Archive (BDA)** (ブロックチェーンデジタルアーカイブ) | The central concept discussed in this book. A mechanism for preserving culture, science, philosophy, and individual records on the blockchain, and inheriting human knowledge in an unalterable form. It aims for the **"continuation of memory,"** not "data preservation." It is the general term for the **"Library that does not perish,"** resurrected in the modern age. |
