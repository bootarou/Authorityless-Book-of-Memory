📘 Authorityless Book of Memory

A Philosophical Record on Blockchain, Time, and Human Memory

“Don’t trust, verify.” – Satoshi Nakamoto
“Yes, I just record in me.” – Bootarou

This repository contains the full manuscript of The Authorityless Book of Memory,
a philosophical and technical reflection on the evolution of blockchain as humanity’s new memory system.

It explores how Bitcoin introduced the first incorruptible record of time,
how Symbol extended it into a record of meaning,
and how these technologies may transform human civilization from one that “believes”
to one that records, verifies, and remembers.

Written in 2025 by Bootarou, a pioneer of full on-chain data archiving (NFTDrive, CHRONOTH),
this work stands as both a meditation and a warning—
a reminder that technology, when stripped of authority, becomes humanity’s purest memory.

This is not a technical whitepaper.
It is a philosophical document — a record of our age,
written for those who will read it a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years from now.
